ðŸ§  Project Description:
This project leverages supervised and unsupervised machine learning to analyze and understand the nutritional content of vegetables.

Supervised Classification: A model is trained to classify vegetables into predefined categories like Leafy, Root, Cruciferous, etc., using nutritional attributes (such as protein, fat, fiber, sugar, calories, etc.).

Unsupervised Clustering (Segmentation): We use K-Means Clustering to group similar vegetables together based on their nutritional makeup â€” without using any predefined labels. This can help discover hidden patterns or nutritional similarities between different vegetables.
